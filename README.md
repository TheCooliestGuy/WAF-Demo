# WAF-Demo

## Installation
Intended for use on Mozilla Firefox.

The site must be hosted on a local server.

You may use any program to do this, but I used node.js **http-server**

To install http-server, run npm with sudo:
- `$ npm install -g http-server`
- `-g` installs globally on your machine
- If the command doesn't work, you may need to run it with `sudo` permissions

## Running

To start the server, run http server in the project root:
`$ http-server`

This will host the server on **localhost:8080** by default

Read the http-server documentation at the link below, to learn more about changing the server port:
